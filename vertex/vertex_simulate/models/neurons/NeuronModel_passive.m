    % as passive neurons can't spike on their own, this method allows
    % spikes to be assigned to them, intended particularly for use in the
    % multiregional simulations where dummy passive neurons work as
    % conduits for the spikes that should be passed from another external
    % population. 'spikes' should be a logical vector the length of the
    % number of passive dummy neurons in the current region.
